## Introduction

**Project Managed** is a microservices-based application designed to efficiently handle project management, user management, comments, suggestions, and audit logging. Each microservice is implemented independently, allowing for scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment. This modular architecture ensures that each component can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, optimizing resource utilization and system performance.

## 🧐 Microservices Overview <a name = "microservices-overview"></a>

### User Login <a name = "user-login"></a>
- **Actor:** User
- **Preconditions:** The user must be registered in the system.
- **Main Flow:**
  1. The user enters their email and password in the login interface.
  2. The system verifies that the email is registered.
  3. The system validates the password.
  4. If credentials are correct, a JWT token is generated.
  5. The login attempt is logged in the Audit Microservice.
  6. The user receives the JWT token.
- **Alternative Flow:**
  - If the email is not registered, the system returns an error.
  - If the password is incorrect, the system returns an error.
- **Postconditions:** The user has successfully logged in and has a valid JWT token.

### Projects Microservice <a name = "projects-microservice"></a>
- **Actor:** User
- **Preconditions:** The user must be authenticated.
- **Main Flow:**
  1. The user creates a new project by entering the necessary data.
  2. The system saves the project in the database.
  3. The user can view the list of all projects.
  4. The user selects a project to view in detail.
  5. The user updates the project information.
  6. The user deletes a project.
- **Alternative Flow:**
  - If the project does not exist when trying to view or update it, the system returns an error.
- **Postconditions:** The project is created, updated, viewed, or deleted as applicable.

### User Microservice <a name = "user-microservice"></a>
- **Actor:** Administrator
- **Preconditions:** The administrator must be authenticated.
- **Main Flow:**
  1. The administrator creates a new user.
  2. The system saves the user in the database.
  3. The administrator views the list of all users.
  4. The administrator selects a user to view details.
  5. The administrator updates the user information.
  6. The administrator deletes a user.
- **Alternative Flow:**
  - If the user does not exist when trying to view or update it, the system returns an error.
- **Postconditions:** The user is created, updated, viewed, or deleted as applicable.

### Comments Microservice <a name = "comments-microservice"></a>
- **Actor:** User
- **Preconditions:** The user must be authenticated.
- **Main Flow:**
  1. The user creates a new comment on a project.
  2. The system saves the comment in the database.
  3. The user views the list of all comments on a project.
  4. The user updates a comment.
  5. The user deletes a comment.
- **Alternative Flow:**
  - If the comment does not exist when trying to view or update it, the system returns an error.
- **Postconditions:** The comment is created, updated, viewed, or deleted as applicable.

### Suggestions Microservice <a name = "suggestions-microservice"></a>
- **Actor:** User
- **Preconditions:** The user must be authenticated.
- **Main Flow:**

  3. The user views the list of all suggestions.
  4. The user updates a suggestion.
  5. The user deletes a suggestion.
- **Alternative Flow:**
  - If the suggestion does not exist when trying to view or update it, the system returns an error.
- **Postconditions:** The suggestion is created, updated, viewed, or deleted as applicable.

### Audit Microservice <a name = "audit-microservice"></a>
- **Actor:** System (Automatic)
- **Preconditions:** A login attempt event must be received by the system.
